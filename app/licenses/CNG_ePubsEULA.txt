-------------------------------------------------

WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU PRINT THIS "FONT SOFTWARE FOR ELECTRONIC PUBLICATIONS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT" FOR FURTHER REFERENCE. This Font Software for Electronic Publications End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) becomes a binding contract between you and Foundry when you click on the area marked “ACCEPT LICENSE AGREEMENT,” or similar language or when you accept the Agreement by other means (for instance referring to the Agreement in a purchase order, a confirmation email etc.). If you do not wish to be bound by the Agreement, you cannot access, use or download the Font Software. Please read this entire Agreement before agreeing to be bound. The Agreement contains capitalized terms that are defined in Section 12 of the Agreement.

You hereby agree to the following:

1.	Binding Agreement. You are bound by the Agreement and you acknowledge that all use of the Font Software supplied to you by Foundry for the purposes set forth under this Agreement is governed by this Agreement.

2.	License Grant. You are hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable license (subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement) to (a) embed the Font Software (i) into an Electronic Publication, including an Electronic Publication that is a Commercial Product, (ii) in a secure manner which does not allow an End User to access to the Font Software outside of an Electronic Publication, and (b) distribute worldwide (subject to the export restrictions set forth in section 9 of the Terms and Conditions) such Electronic Publication to End Users. Foundry reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement.

3.	Restrictions on Use.

•	The maximum number of separate and distinct Electronic Publications into which the Font Software may be embedded may not exceed the number of Electronic Publications indicated on your invoice when licensing the Font Software.

•	For avoidance of doubt, each Issue of an Electronic Publication counts as a separate Electronic Publication, however regional or format variations of each Issue of an Electronic Publication shall not count as a separate Issue.

•	The Font Software must be embedded within a file format that protects the Font Software by means of encryption or obfuscation. Formats that meet these criteria include, but are not limited to, PDF, EPUB 2.01, EPUB 3, and KF8. The Electronic Publication must be a non-executable file which is displayed by e-reader software or on e-reader devices. Font Software may not be installed in the operating system on which the Electronic Publication runs.

•	You agree that you will take no action which will have the direct or indirect effect of causing the Font Software thereof to become Publicly Available Software or otherwise be subject to a Publicly Available Software agreement.

4.	Alterations to the Font Software. You may not alter the Font Software for the purpose of adding any functionality that such Font Software did not have when delivered to you by Foundry. If the Font Software contains embedding bits that indicate that the Font Software is only authorized for certain purposes, you may not change or alter the embedding bits.

5.	Transfer of the Font Software. You may not rent, lease, sublicense, give, lend, or further distribute the Font Software, or any copy thereof. If you are a business or organization, you agree that in case of a reasonable doubt with regard to the proper use of the Font Software within your organization, upon request from Foundry or its authorized representative, you will within thirty (30) days fully document and certify that use of any and all Font Software at the time of the request is in conformity with your valid licenses from Foundry.

6.	Copies. You may not copy the Font Software, except as expressly provided herein. You may make a reasonable number of back-up copies of the Font Software for archival purposes only, and you shall retain exclusive custody and control over such copies. Any copies that you are expressly permitted to make pursuant to the Agreement must contain the same copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Font Software. Upon termination of the Agreement, you must destroy the original and any and all copies of the Font Software.

You agree that the Font Software, its structure, organization, code, and related files are valuable property of Foundry or its third party licensors and that any intentional or negligent use of the Font Software not expressly permitted by the Agreement constitutes an infringement of intellectual and industrial property rights.

You further agree not to use the Font Software in connection with software and/or hardware which create Derivative Works of such Font Software.
